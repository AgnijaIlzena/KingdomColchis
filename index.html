      <h2>The role of the Royal Family of Colchis</h2>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Members of the Royal Family support The King in his many State and
          national duties, as well as carrying out important work in the areas
          of public and charitable service, and helping to strengthen national
          unity and stability.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Every year the Royal Family as a whole carries out over 1,000 official
        engagements throughout the Colchis and worldwide.
      </p>
      <p>
        When official events such as receptions, State banquets and garden
        parties are held, the Royal Family supports The King in making her
        guests welcome.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Royal Family also plays an important role in recognising and
        supporting the work of the Armed Services. Members of the Royal Family
        have official relationships with many units of the Forces, paying
        regular visits to soldiers, sailors and airmen serving at home and
        abroad.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, the Royal Family as a whole plays a role in strengthening
        national unity. Members of the Royal Family are able to recognise and
        participate in community and local events in every part of the Colchis,
        from the opening of new buildings to celebrations or acts of
        commemoration.
